IMPORTANT:
allow tasks to be completed, which greys them out
make all data-editing functions also edit the database
make delete task button work, be sure to delete all subtasks, and check if tasklist empty, if so get ready to redefine baseTaskID, maybe if tasklist empty we could reset ID count to 0.
fill name and description input boxes with contents of whatever task is selected once upon selecting (not ngModel), until changed manually

FIXES:
DeleteTask() is NOT working, crashes when using, something to to with infinite recursion I think;
the function seems to work perfectly according to the console log but then seconds later crashes for seemingly no reason, might be backend angular/typescript stuff I dont know
