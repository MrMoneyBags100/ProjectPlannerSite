IMPORTANT:

allow tasks to be completed, which greys them out
add a taskbar to the task tree (for add, delete, edit)

FIXES:
Please rework/remake the NewTask function in TaskService, not currently used but needs to be working before New/Delete/Edit features are added
create toolbar for task tree
make a little toggle button for expanding tasks instead of the entire card
allow tasks to be selected by clicking on it(how we currently toggle expand a task)
make all data-editing functions also edit the database
